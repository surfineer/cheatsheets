~ Virtual Environments ~

1) in project directory: 
python -m venv [venvname]

virtualenv [ProjectName]                    
creates virtual environment (directory) at given path

[from project-path]>[python-version-path.exe] -m venv [name-venv-eg.venv]
python3 -m venv myapp
creates from specific python version virtual environment in project directory

2) activate it!
Linux / Bash: source [venvName]/bin(or Scripts)/activate
Windows: [venvName]\Scripts\activate.bat
activates virtual env

## FLASK ##

flask --app app.py --debug run         runs flask in debug mode
flask run                              runs all python files starting from app.py (no app.run() statement required)
python app.py                           will only run one flask file (needs the app.run() statement at the bottom)
the following commands help not having to restart the server everytime changes are made
cmd: set FLASK_DEBUG=1                  activates the Flask debugger (do this before running flask)
bash: export FLASK_DEBUG=1              sets the local server in development mode
export FLASK_APP=hello.py               tell flask which file to run (default is app.py)
